# @a-la/import

%NPM: @a-la/import%

`@a-la/import` is a a set of rules for [`alamode`](https://alamode.cc) to transpile the `import` statement into a `require` call in Node.js.

_Ã€ La Mode_ is a RegExp-based transpiler which works faster than AST-based transpilers such as `@babel`, has fewer dependencies, and occupies less disk space.

```sh
yarn add -E @a-la/import
```
