# @a-la/import

%NPM: @a-la/import%

`@a-la/import` is a a set of rules for [`alamode`](https://alamode.cc) to transpile `import` statements into `require` calls in Node.JS.

_Ã€LaMode_ is a RegExp-based transpiler which works faster than AST-based transpilers such as `@babel`, has no dependencies and occupies less disk space.

```sh
yarn add @a-la/import
```
